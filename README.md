# DesignPattren

This repository serves as a collection of design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design and development. By studying and understanding these patterns, developers can create more flexible, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

## Implemented Design Patterns

Here's a list of design patterns currently implemented in this repository:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. **Observer Pattern**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

4. **Builder Pattern**: Allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

5. **Strategy Pattern**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Usage

To use the design patterns implemented in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/root-2002/DesignPattren.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd DesignPattren
   ```

3. Explore the individual design pattern implementations in their respective packages.

4. To use a specific design pattern in your project, copy the relevant files into your project directory and integrate them as needed.
